# POODLE 🐩
## CLI Tool for Moodle Plugin development
---
Many of the most used and powerful web development frameworks around the world work with the help of a *CLI* tool in order to ease the development job.

The idea behind this project is to provide a *CLI* tool for ***Moodle*** as well, so that **Moodle Plugin** developers can work with ease, and avoid common human mistakes when developing, leaving the hard work of creating files and structuring folders for the machine.

## Documentation
### Instalation

For Mac and Linux users:

    sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matheus-crivellari/Poodle/master/poodle > poodle

For Windows users: 

    explorer.exe https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matheus-crivellari/Poodle/master/poodle > poodle

### Getting started
1. Create a folder where we're going to put our plugin files inside;

2. Then enter at the created folder and paste the poodle file inside it;


3. The first and handful command, is `init`, it brings up a basic folder structure and the minimum required files for a Moodle plugin to work.

        php poodle init <type> <name> <"Exhibition name">
    - `<type>` (required): Following the Frankenstyle Moodle's convention for naming a plugin you must choose one of the available [plugin types](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Plugin_types);
    - `<name>` (required): Following the Frankenstyle Moodle's convention for naming a plugin you must choose a name for your plugin;
    - `<"Exibition name">` (optional): You can set an exhibition name which will be displayed to the user in Moodle administration pages, if you leave it blank, it will use the same value as the component name which is `<type>`_`<name>`;

### Useful features
#### 1. Creating locale files and folders

    php poodle lang add <language>

- Following Moodle convention for naming languages, use the command above to add a new language folder to your plugin which will inherit all the string keys registered for the default *'en'* locale;

#### 2. Adding string keys to your locale

    php poodle str add <key> <value>

- `<key>` (required): Enter the key name for your new string;
- `<value>` (optional): Enter a default value for your new string. This parameter is optional, if ommited it will leave the new string locale entry as an empty string;

#### 3. Adding scheduled cron tasks

    php tasks add <task_name>

- `<task_name>` (required): Following the Frankenstyle Moodle's convention, enter the name for your scheduled task;

#### 4. CLI help
    php poodle help

- Run the command above to display a list with all the current available commands.
